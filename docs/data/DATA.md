# Data

Data is currently generated from a Wikidata JSON dump loaded into Hadoop on the Wikimedia Foundation Analaytics cluster. See DATA-NEW.md

Old data can also be gathered from the old wikidata-analysis project, See DATA-OLD.md

Once data is collected, it then needs to be turned into pizel data, for that see DATA-PIXELS.md
